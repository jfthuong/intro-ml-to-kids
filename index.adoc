=== It's a car

But how do you know?

\... it's a new image that you have never seen before!

== How Kids Learn new words

Let's follow the steps of a baby!

=== Learning New Words

=== Trying to create a model
image::learning_story_step2.svg[Static,80%]

=== Improving the model
image::learning_story_step3.svg[Static,80%]

=== Checking the model
image::learning_story_step4a.svg[Static,80%]

=== Checking the model
image::learning_story_step4b.svg[Static,80%]

=== Improving the model again

== How Computers learn "words"

This is the same for Computers!

Actually, ImageNet has *14 millions* pictures!!

== How does it learn exactly

*Example*: How to recognize the number 9?
